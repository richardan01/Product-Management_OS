# Peer Review

**Agent:** Orchestrator (Alfred voice) — see `Agents/README.md` voice map.

Evaluate any agent's output file against **two layers of quality standards**:
1. **Agent-specific checks** — the quality gates defined in the producing agent's agent file
2. **Personal ground truth** — [YOUR_NAME]'s 5 criteria in `Knowledge/Reference/ground-truth.md`

Run this before passing any output to the next agent in the chain, and before sharing anything externally with [YOUR_MANAGER], [HEAD_OF_DEPT], or the broader team.

Usage: `peer-review [file path]`
Example: `peer-review Projects/[YOUR_ANCHOR_PROJECT]/vendor-scorecard.md`

---

## Step 1 — Read the Target File

Read the file the user specified. Identify:
- What type of document it is (PRD, research synthesis, strategy, proposal, business case, etc.)
- Which agent produced it (infer from file path, structure, or content)
- Whether it is intended for internal use or external sharing ([YOUR_MANAGER], [HEAD_OF_DEPT], engineering)

---

## Step 2 — Check for External Reviewer Comments

Before scoring, scan the conversation and the document itself for evidence of prior reviewer feedback:
- Has the user mentioned [YOUR_MANAGER], [HEAD_OF_DEPT], or any named reviewer?
- Has the user pasted comments, markup, or a review note alongside the file?
- Does the document contain a comments section, tracked changes, or explicit "Reviewer notes"?

If yes: extract all comments into a numbered list. Evaluate each under Layer 2, Criterion 5.
If no: mark Criterion 5 as N/A.

---

## Step 3 — Layer 1: Agent-Specific Quality Checks

Identify the producing agent and read its quality checks from the appropriate agent file.

**Pass 1 — Structural scan**
Check the document type against `Knowledge/Reference/ground-truth.md` → "Document-Type Templates" to find the required sections for that type. List each required section and mark it as present, partial, or missing. Flag any placeholders (TBD, TODO, insert here).

**Pass 2 — Agent quality check**
Score each quality check from the producing agent's file:

```
**Layer 1 — Agent Quality Checks ([Agent Name])**

| Check | Status | Evidence / Gap |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| [check from agent file] | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ? Cannot Assess | [specific finding] |

Layer 1 Score: [n Pass] / [n total checks]
```

---

## Step 4 — Layer 2: Personal Ground Truth

Read `Knowledge/Reference/ground-truth.md`. Apply all 5 criteria to the document regardless of type.

```
**Layer 2 — Personal Ground Truth**

| # | Criterion | Score | Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Structure & Completeness | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Fail | [specific finding] |
| 2 | Clarity & Writing Quality | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Fail | [specific finding] |
| 3 | Strategic Alignment ([YOUR_COMPANY]) | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Fail | [specific finding] |
| 4 | Actionability | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Fail | [specific finding] |
| 5 | External Reviewer Comments | ✅ Pass / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Fail / ⏭️ N/A | [finding or "N/A — no reviewer comments detected"] |

Layer 2 Score: [n Pass] / 5 criteria
```

---

## Step 5 — Overall Verdict

```
**Overall Verdict: CLEARED ✅ / CONDITIONAL ⚠️ / NEEDS REVISION ❌**
```

Rules:
- **CLEARED** — all Layer 1 checks pass AND all Layer 2 criteria are Pass or N/A
- **CONDITIONAL** — 1–2 items are Partial across both layers, none are Fail
- **NEEDS REVISION** — any item is Fail, or 3+ items are Partial across both layers

---

## Step 6 — Fix Checklist

List every gap as a checkbox, grouped by severity.

```
**🔧 Fix Checklist**

### Must Fix (Blocking)
- [ ] [L2 · Criterion 3] Tie metric to specific [YOUR_COMPANY] context — Section 2 is generic.

### Should Fix (Important — fix before external sharing)
- [ ] [L2 · Criterion 4] Assign owner to open action — Section 3.

### Nice to Fix (Minor — polish)
- [ ] [L2 · Criterion 2] Remove filler phrase — Executive Summary, line 1.
```

---

## Step 7 — Revised Version (if needed)

If verdict is NEEDS REVISION or CONDITIONAL, produce a corrected version applying all Must Fix and Should Fix items.

---

## Step 8 — Outcome & Next Steps

```
**🎯 Outcome & Next Steps**

**Expected outcome after fixes:** [1–2 sentences]

**Your action sequence:**
1. [Highest-severity fix first]
2. [Next item]
```

## Verdict file (per `_Registry/reviewer-verdict-schema.md`)

On PASS (or CONDITIONAL-PASS), write `<doc-path>.peer-review-passed` with the byte-exact 4-line header + scorecard.
