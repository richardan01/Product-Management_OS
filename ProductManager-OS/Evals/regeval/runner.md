description: Run one RegEval autoresearch experiment — vary one scaffold element, score against gold, keep or discard. Trigger on "/regeval-run", "regeval experiment", "run a regeval variant". Enforces the 5-min wall-clock budget and writes to experiments/log.md. The metric is the reviewer.

# RegEval runner — `/regeval-run <scaffold-name>`

**Voice:** Lucius Fox. Precise, build-grade, terse on success and explicit on failure.

## What this skill does

Runs **one** experiment in the autoresearch loop. One experiment = one variation of one scaffold element. Multiple experiments per session run by re-invoking this skill.

## Preconditions (refuse if any miss)

1. `Evals/regeval/inputs/gold.jsonl` exists and has ≥ 30 labelled items.
2. `Evals/regeval/scaffolds/current.md` exists (the champion).
3. The candidate variant exists at `Evals/regeval/scaffolds/candidates/<name>.md`.
4. The 60-min session budget has not been exceeded (check `budget.md`).

If any precondition fails, stop and surface the gap. Do not improvise.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Start the experiment file
Create `Evals/regeval/experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD-NN>-<slug>.md` from `_template.md`. NN is the day's nth experiment, zero-padded.

Capture upfront:
- **Hypothesis** — one sentence: "Changing X to Y will improve κ because Z."
- **Scaffold delta** — what specifically differs from `current.md` (a diff or a 3-bullet summary).
- **Wall-clock start** — UTC timestamp.

### 2. Run against gold
Execute the candidate scaffold over every item in `gold.jsonl`. Record raw judge outputs into the experiment file under `## Raw outputs` (collapsible).

### 3. Compute κ + diagnostics
Per [metric.md](metric.md): κ, TPR, TNR, abstention rate, per-class κ, N, 95% CI.

If wall-clock exceeds 8 min, **kill the run** and log it as a failed experiment with reason "budget exceeded". Do not extend.

### 4. Verdict (the metric is the reviewer)

| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| κ ≥ 0.80 **and** abstention < 50% **and** CI lower bound ≥ 0.70 | **Keep.** Overwrite `scaffolds/current.md`. Append `KEEP` row to `log.md`. |
| κ ≥ champion's κ but below 0.80 | **Hold.** Do not overwrite. Append `HOLD` row. Useful direction. |
| κ < champion's κ, or suspicious diagnostics | **Discard.** No overwrite. Append `DISCARD` row. |
| Run killed for budget | **Failed.** Append `FAIL` row with reason. |

### 5. Append the one-line log entry

`experiments/log.md` is the compounding artifact. One line per experiment, never edited retroactively:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD | NN | <slug>           | <verdict> | κ=<x.xx> | TPR=<x.xx> TNR=<x.xx> abst=<x.xx> N=<n> | <one-sentence why> |
```

### 6. Update `budget.md`
Record minutes spent. If session total ≥ 60 min, refuse further `/regeval-run` calls in this session.

## Output format

```
## RegEval experiment <date>-<NN> — <slug>

**Verdict:** KEEP / HOLD / DISCARD / FAIL
**κ:** <x.xx> (95% CI [<lo>, <hi>])  vs champion <x.xx>
**Diagnostics:** TPR=<x.xx> · TNR=<x.xx> · abst=<x.xx> · N=<n>
**Wall clock:** <m>:<ss>

**Hypothesis:** <one sentence>
**Scaffold delta:** <bullets>

**Why this verdict (one sentence):** <reason>

**Next experiment suggestion (one line):** <if applicable>
```

## Anti-patterns (the runner refuses these)

- Editing `current.md` directly (only the runner overwrites, only on KEEP)
- Running without an explicit hypothesis (no fishing)
- Re-grading a prior experiment's outputs to "find" a better κ
- Extending past the 8-min hard kill
- Skipping `log.md` append "to clean up later"

## Walking-away rule

After 12 experiments or 60 minutes, this skill refuses further runs in the same session. Karpathy: ~100 experiments while you sleep — yours run while you don't. Come back tomorrow.
