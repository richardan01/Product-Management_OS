# RegEval — Autoresearch loop

**Owner:** Lucius Fox (build) · Bruce Wayne (kill/keep) · Henri Ducard (depth review)
**Q3 thesis tie:** flagship deliverable; Day-30 signpost = first credible run.
**Karpathy frame:** one runner, one metric, one fixed time budget, compounding log. The metric is the reviewer.

## What this loop optimizes

A **judge-alignment scaffold** for regulated-domain LLM output. The artifact under test is the *scaffold* (prompt, decomposition, abstention policy, judge rubric) — not the underlying model. Each experiment varies one element of the scaffold, runs against the gold dataset, scores, and is kept or discarded.

This is Karpathy's autoresearch shape: many small bets, fast cycle, single metric, tight budget.

## The metric (single, named, falsifiable)

**Cohen's κ between LLM-as-judge and the human gold label**, computed over the gold dataset.

- κ ≥ 0.80 → judge is a credible stand-in for human labelers ("substantial agreement")
- 0.60 ≤ κ < 0.80 → directional only; do not ship
- κ < 0.60 → judge is unreliable; treat the scaffold as failing

Secondary diagnostics (logged, not optimized): TPR, TNR, abstention rate. These exist to catch κ-gaming (e.g. a judge that abstains on everything will look "calibrated" but is useless).

Definition + computation: see [metric.md](metric.md).

## The time budget (fixed; non-negotiable)

| Window | Budget | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| Per experiment | ≤ 5 min wall clock end-to-end | hard kill at 8 min |
| Per session | ≤ 60 min (12 experiments) | walk away after |
| Per week | ≤ 6 hr (Q3 thesis allocation) | RegEval cannibalises nothing else |

If an experiment exceeds 8 min, it is *discarded as a failed experiment*, not extended. Karpathy principle: unbounded effort dilutes all pillars.

## The loop

```
1. Pick ONE scaffold element to vary (prompt section, decomposition step, judge rubric line, abstention threshold)
2. Make the change in scaffolds/<name>.md
3. Run runner against inputs/gold.jsonl
4. Compute κ + diagnostics
5. Append a row to experiments/log.md
6. Keep (overwrite scaffolds/current.md) or discard (no overwrite)
7. Repeat until session budget exhausted
```

Trigger: `/regeval-run <scaffold-name>` (skill at [runner.md](runner.md)).

## Kill / pivot criterion (Day 60 — June 30, 2026)

Per the Q3 thesis: *"Can I record a 5-minute RegEval demo I'd show Hamel Husain without flinching?"*

Concrete signals at Day 60:
- κ ≥ 0.80 on at least one scaffold variant **and** the variant is reproducible from the log
- Gold dataset ≥ 100 labelled items with inter-annotator agreement documented
- One experiment per session-day for the prior 14 days (compounding cadence, not bursts)

Miss any → pivot per thesis-q3-2026.md.

## Anti-patterns (kill on sight)

- Running an experiment without writing it to `log.md` (untracked = didn't happen)
- Editing `scaffolds/current.md` outside a Keep decision (state corruption)
- Optimizing on a held-out set seen during scaffold authoring (leakage)
- Self-graded judge alignment (judge ≠ author of scaffold)
- "Just one more variant" past the 60-min session cap
