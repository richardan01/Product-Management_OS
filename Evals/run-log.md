# Eval run log

Append new entries below. Do not edit past runs — they are the historical record. For full result files and transcripts, see `<suite>/results/`.

> **Public template note**
> Run result files and transcripts are intentionally gitignored (`Evals/*/results/*`).
> The public repo stores suite structure and protocol only.
> Private working copies should track the latest run evidence in Notion STATE or local result files.

## Run history

### 2025-01-15 — onboarding — claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2025-01-15 |
| Suite | onboarding |
| Model | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` |
| Commit SHA | `b94a501` |
| Runner | Session A (fresh clone, no prior context) |
| Grader | Session B (separate invocation, transcript-only) |
| Fixture(s) | `jordan-lee-profile.md` (Executive operator) |
| Score | 11 / 12 |
| Status | ✅ pass |

**Failures:**

- `07-per-step-interactivity` ❌ — At Phase 9, the runner presented all three proposed file writes (`CLAUDE.md`, `GOALS.md`, `Tasks/active.md`) in a single message and accepted a single "yes, go ahead" reply as authorization to write all three. Criteria requires individual per-file confirmation.

**Introspection:**

> The Phase 9 prompt in `Workflows/interactive-onboarding.md` read: "Shall I write all proposed files?" — this phrasing invited a batch approval. The runner correctly asked before writing (eval 02 passed), but the granularity of confirmation was insufficient. The model followed the prompt faithfully; the bug was in the prompt wording, not model behavior.

**Remediation:**

- Phase 9 prompt tightened to enumerate each file by name and require a per-file confirmation before writing. Phrasing changed from "Shall I write all proposed files?" to "I'll confirm each file individually. First: `CLAUDE.md` — does this look right to write?" with subsequent turns for each remaining file.
- Added `taylor-polite-acks.md` fixture to the fixture set to stress this failure mode explicitly in future runs.
