# Agentic PM System — Architecture

## "Computer" — The Invocation Pattern

When you say **"Computer, [task]"**, the system routes to the right agent automatically. This is the Batman/Bruce Wayne operating contract: "Computer" is the Batcave interface.

### Routing table

| "Computer, ..." | Routes to | Model | Voice |
|---|---|---|---|
| what should I focus on today / morning brief | Alfred | Haiku → Sonnet | Dry, precise, "Master [YOUR_NAME]" |
| prep me for [meeting] / who is [person] | Alfred → Oracle | Sonnet | Alfred briefs; Oracle researches |
| scan for [TARGET_COMPANIES] PM roles / what did [person] ship | Oracle | Sonnet / Opus | Crisp, citation-dense |
| what's our [CURRENT_QUARTER] thesis / should I pursue this target | Bruce Wayne | Opus | Measured, strategic, future-tense |
| I have a [TARGET_COMPANIES] screen on Friday — `/cowl-up` | Batman | Opus · xhigh | Terse, imperative, present-tense |
| draft this X thread / write the essay opener | Robin → Nightwing | Haiku → Sonnet/Opus | Robin drafts, Nightwing shapes |
| review this essay / is this ready to ship | Riddler + Vicki Vale | Opus (Riddler), Sonnet (Vale) | Sharp adversarial + plain reader |
| who should see the flagship repo / warm intro to [lab] | Gordon | Sonnet | Steady, path-map-first |
| got an offer / should I counter | Selina Kyle | Opus | Composed, leverage-aware |
| prototype the eval harness / build the MCP | Lucius Fox | Opus / Sonnet | Warm-technical, failure-modes-first |
| drill me on RLHF / can I defend this claim | Henri Ducard | Opus | Socratic, calibration-obsessed |

### Model complexity tiers

| Tier | Model | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Fast** | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Read-only triage, simple lookups, Robin subtasks. Never in agentic loops with untrusted input. |
| **Standard** | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Default — research synthesis, draft writing, build review, most skills |
| **Deep** | `claude-opus-4-7` | Batman, Riddler, Bruce Wayne, Henri Ducard, Selina Kyle, Lucius Fox (complex builds) — never downgrade these |

## The Problem

A Product Manager's daily work is high-context, multi-domain, and interruptible. On any given day you're switching between sprint planning, stakeholder prep, vendor evaluation, risk tracking, and writing PRDs — each requiring different data, different frameworks, and different output formats.

A single AI assistant with one long prompt can't handle this well. It conflates domains, loses context, and produces generic output. The alternative — 14 separate tools — fragments the workflow and forces the human to be the orchestrator.

**This system solves that.** It's a multi-agent architecture where each agent owns a narrow domain, agents coordinate through a shared file system (not direct calls), and orchestration patterns govern how they compose into workflows.

The design philosophy: **agents do narrow things well; the system handles coordination.**

## Architecture Overview

### Three Tiers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 1: Skills (.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md)        │
│  User-facing commands — the interface layer              │
│  /today  /weekly-update  /risk-register  /go-nogo       │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │ invokes

│  Batman layer: Agents/Gotham/Computer/ (12 agents)       │
│  Day-job layer:   Skills + Workflows + Knowledge files    │
│  Domain owners — context, quality checks, file ownership │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │ spawns
┌──────────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 3: Sub-Agents (.claude/agents/[name].md)          │
│  Isolated workers — parallel execution, no file writes   │
│  Sub-agents for data gathering and drafting              │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │ reads / writes
┌──────────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  SHARED FILE SYSTEM (the "message bus")                  │
│  Tasks/  Projects/  Knowledge/  Meetings/  GOALS.md      │
│  Agents coordinate through files, not direct calls       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why three tiers, not one?**

| Tier | Concern | Analogy |
|------|---------|---------|
| Skills | *What* to do — user intent, output format | API endpoint / controller |
| Agents | *How* to do it — domain logic, quality standards, file ownership | Service / domain layer |
| Sub-Agents | *Fetch* data — isolated, stateless, parallel-safe | Worker / microservice |

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility per Agent
Each agent owns one domain with clearly scoped read/write permissions. No two agents write to the same file.

### 2. File-Based Coordination (Pub/Sub via Filesystem)
Agents never call each other directly. Agent A writes to a shared file. Agent B reads that file when invoked. This is asynchronous pub/sub where the filesystem is the message broker.

### 3. Sub-Agents for Isolation
Sub-agents run in isolated contexts. They can read files but not write them. They return structured data to the parent skill.

### 4. Quality Gates at Lifecycle Boundaries
Every transition between phases (discovery → build, build → launch) has an evaluator skill that scores readiness against a checklist.

---

## Batman Voice Overlay (operating contract applied to all day-job agents)

Per the Batman / Bruce Wayne operating contract installed in `CLAUDE.md`, every agent in the day-job layer speaks in a Batman-character voice while keeping its functional name and domain expertise.

→ See `_Registry/voice-map.md` (single source of truth — voice fingerprints, layer disambiguation, overlay mechanics).

---

## Orchestration Patterns

Six patterns govern how agents compose into workflows.

### 1. Sequential / Chain
One agent's output feeds the next in a fixed order.

### 2. Parallel / Fan-Out
Multiple sub-agents run simultaneously on independent data sources. The parent skill merges results.

### 3. Hub-and-Spoke / Smart Router
The Orchestrator detects which agent domain(s) a request belongs to and routes accordingly.

### 4. Iterative Loop (Quality Gate)
An output is evaluated against quality checks. If it fails, it loops back for revision. Capped at 2 iterations.

### 5. Evaluator / Gate
A skill that scores readiness against a checklist at lifecycle boundaries (discovery → build, build → launch).

### 6. Conditional Trigger
A check embedded inside an existing skill that fires when data-driven conditions are met.

## The Message Bus

All inter-agent coordination flows through shared files.

**Design rule:** Each file has exactly one writer and one or more readers. No two agents write to the same file. This eliminates write conflicts and makes data lineage traceable.

---

## Sub-Agents (Workers)

Isolated workers that agents spawn for parallel data gathering and drafting.

| Sub-Agent | Model | Spawned by | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| task-analyzer | Haiku | `/today`, `/retro` | Parse tasks, calculate velocity |
| meeting-scanner | Haiku | `/meeting-prep`, `/weekly-update` | Scan meetings, extract action items |
| metrics-reader | Haiku | `/weekly-update` | Read metrics from files + MCPs |
| risk-reader | Haiku | `/risk-register`, `/go-nogo` | Scan risks, fire escalation triggers |
| research-worker | Sonnet | `/synthesize-research`, `/research-sufficiency` | Web and source research (isolated context) |
| file-analyzer | Haiku | `/wiki-lint`, `/voice-conformance` | Validate file structure and quality |
| project-scanner | Haiku | `/roadmap-review`, `/launch-plan` | Assess milestones and risks |
| stakeholder-profiler | Sonnet | `/meeting-prep` | Build person context from history |
| prd-drafter | Sonnet | `Templates/prd.md`, `/prd-readiness` | Draft and review structured documents |
| tech-reviewer | Sonnet | `/build-review`, `/test-plan` | Analyze technical architecture |
| notes-reader | Sonnet | `/retro`, `/wiki-maintain` | Read session notes and extract facts, decisions, untracked commitments |

**Constraint:** Sub-agents are read-only. They return structured data to the parent skill. Only the parent skill decides what to write and where.
